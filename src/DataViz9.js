                      <Introduction>
                        <p>The transition from middle school to high school is a big one, perhaps bigger than appears at first blush: Not only do studentsâ€™ academic workloads increase, but simultaneously, so does their independence and responsibility. More students fail ninth grade than any other grade in high school, and a disproportionate number of students who are held back in ninth grade subsequently drop out. A student who passes all grade 9 courses is 14 times more likely to graduate high school in 4 years. Below, explore in detail the link between failing a course in ninth grade  and on-time graduation.</p>
